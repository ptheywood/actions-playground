This repo is just a simple project to mess around with github actions, that is lighter-weight to execute than in [[ptheywood/cuda-cmake-github-actions]] where CUDA is installed during the process... 

Includes a helloWorld CMake application, as cmake is likely going to be my main point of contact with github actions.

Arbitrary change!
